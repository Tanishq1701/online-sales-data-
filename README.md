# Online Sales Data Analysis

## Overview
This project analyzes a dataset of online sales to uncover insights into sales trends, product performance, and customer behavior. By performing data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and visualizations, the project aims to provide actionable insights for optimizing business strategies, such as identifying top-performing products, peak sales periods, and customer preferences.

## Features
- **Data Cleaning**: Handles missing values, duplicates, and inconsistencies to ensure data quality.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Analyzes sales patterns, product categories, and customer demographics.
- **Visualizations**: Generates charts (e.g., bar plots, line graphs) to illustrate sales trends, revenue by product, and other key metrics.
- **Business Insights**: Identifies top-selling products, peak sales hours, and correlations between variables to inform decision-making.

## Dataset
The dataset (`online-sales-data.csv`) contains records of online sales transactions. Key columns include:
- Order ID
- Product Name
- Quantity Ordered
- Price Each
- Order Date
- Customer Location (e.g., city, state)

*Note*: For a detailed dataset description, refer to the dataset file or update this section with specific column details.

## Installation
To run the analysis, ensure you have the following prerequisites installed:

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- Required Python libraries:
  ```bash
  pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn jupyter
  ```

### Setup
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Tanishq1701/online-sales-data-.git
   cd online-sales-data-
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
   *Note*: If a `requirements.txt` file is not present, install the libraries listed above.
3. Open the Jupyter notebook or Python script:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook analysis.ipynb
   ```

## Usage
1. **Run the Analysis**:
   - Open `analysis.ipynb` (or the main script) in Jupyter Notebook.
   - Execute the cells to perform data cleaning, EDA, and generate visualizations.
2. **Explore Visualizations**:
   - View generated plots (e.g., sales by month, top products by revenue) saved in the `plots/` directory or displayed in the notebook.
3. **Customize Analysis**:
   - Modify the code to focus on specific metrics (e.g., sales by region, product category) or add new visualizations.

Example command to run a Python script (if applicable):
```bash
python analysis.py
```

## Results
Key insights from the analysis include:
- Identification of top-selling products and categories.
- Peak sales periods (e.g., specific months or hours).
- Revenue trends and customer purchasing patterns.

Refer to the notebook or output files for detailed results and visualizations.
